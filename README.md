[Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/arpitmishra917/disease-risk-prediction)

## 📌 Overview
Disease Risk Predictor is a machine learning application that predicts the probability of disease occurrence from basic health indicators.  
It uses a **binary classification model** trained with **Scikit-learn**, provides a **Streamlit interface** for real-time inference, and exposes **FastAPI REST APIs** for programmatic access.  
The project is containerized with **Docker**, deployed on **AWS EC2**, and automated with **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.
